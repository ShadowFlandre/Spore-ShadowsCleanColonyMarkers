**<h1>Shadow's Clean Colony Markers.<h6>**

**THIS MOD REQUIRES VANILLACOLD'S EFFECTS OVERRIDER MOD TO RUN! LINK BELOW!**

https://github.com/VanillaCold/Spore-EffectOverrider/releases/latest


A Spore modification that cleans up your colony markers. This is done by simplifying the design to make it look simple while improving performance! This is done by changing the sprites down from 4 per marker to 2, and placing them on the star when zooming out while also being a dot.
(Galaxy texture here or empire color is not included!)
